# stuffGrapher

Light weight graphing tool for pipelining, batch execution and automation.

It's possible I'd be way better off forking another application (Gaffer or similar), but writing stuff from scratch is fun, and this way we can tailor make it more to our pipeline.

I'll probably have to make this closed source once it's more tightly integrated with in house libraries.
